Symbolic definition of forms : magnetic field
=============================================

We compute the magnetic field generated by a coil placed on a
C-core. We see how to

* model a 3D constructive solid geometry
* set material properties from domain and boundary labels
* define bilinear- and linear forms symbolically using trial- and testfunctions
