Working with meshes
===================


In this example (:download:`merge.py</../external_dependencies/netgen/py_tutorials/merge.py>`) we create two geometries (a cube and a sphere fitting inside), and mesh them. Then, we manually merge the surface meshes, and create a unified volume mesh, where the sphere and its complement are two different sub-domains.
